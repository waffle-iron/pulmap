#4. geoserver styles for princeton material - nyu has good example
#5. fix coveralls
6. logo -> something like nyu's. very nice.
# 7. #61 map width issue
#8. #77 hide more details in show page
#9. #78 don't go home after sign index
#10. // it does, but not when there are no query params #88 Back to search button does not take user back to search. Maybe issue should be default search doesnt actually add * query param
